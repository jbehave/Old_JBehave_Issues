Hi All

I'm currently using JBehave and getting to the stage where I have quite a few scenarios, subsequently I am starting to notice increasing amounts of repetitive steps.  I had hoped to push the common pre-requisites out to GivenStories and save the repetition. 

The problem is that I'm currently using @AfterScenario to tidy up before the next scenario, which fires at the end of the GivenStory Scenario as well as the Scenario under test; however in the case of a GivenStories I do not want this to happen as I am effectively trying to use them to set up the preconditions.

I'm not sure if I am missing a configuration option or I am either misusing the @AfterScenario or GivenStories.

Any advice?

Thanks
Nick

GivenStories scenarios are currently treated as normal ones.

We can add enhancement easily, as for parametrised scenarios.

Please raise JIRA issue.

Cheers
